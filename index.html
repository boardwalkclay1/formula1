    <!-- HERO / EXPLANATION -->

      <h2>Simple, Obvious Setups Only</h2>
      <p>
        Golden Formula is built to think like I do when I trade: clear moving average crosses,
        obvious highs and lows, clean even numbers, and simple reversal patterns. No complicated
        stock language—just “up or down”, “where to enter”, and “where to cut it”.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use this app, you’re not getting a random signal generator—you’re getting my
        personal logic, encoded into rules, so it feels like I’m sitting right next to you,
        walking you through the chart.

      <h2>Trade Alive – My Trading Academy</h2>
      <p>
        Trade Alive is my trading academy and education hub. If you want to understand how the
        market actually works—beyond hype, beyond guessing—that’s where I break everything down.
        I’ve spent over 10 years learning, testing, and refining these ideas so you don’t have to
        do it alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same logic that powers this app is what I used to turn a small account into
        <strong>$40,000 in 5 days</strong>. Not by gambling, but by following clear rules,
        respecting risk, and only taking the most obvious setups.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to go deeper, learn the full system, and see how all of this fits together,
        you can go straight to my academy and code here:

      </p>
      <p>
        This app is meant to help you overcome one of the hardest parts of trading: doing it
        alone. With Golden Formula, you can upload a chart and instantly see how I would read it,
        what I would look for, and how I would think about the trade. It won’t replace learning,
        but it will make the learning feel like you’re not in the dark anymore.
      </p>

    <!-- HOW TO USE / PHOTO UPLOAD -->
    <section class="gf-tool">
      <h2>How to Use the Golden Formula Simulator</h2>
      <p>
        The simulator is designed so you don’t have to guess what to type. You can simply upload
        a screenshot of your chart, and the app will read the numbers for you using OCR
        (image-to-text). From there, it runs everything through my personal rule engine and gives
        you guidance as if I’m right there with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s the flow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Upload a chart screenshot:</strong> Take a clear screenshot of your stock chart (with price, highs/lows, and moving averages visible) and upload it below.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Auto-read the numbers:</strong> The app uses Tesseract to read the text from the image and fill in the price, day high/low, and moving averages.</li>
        <li><strong>3. My logic runs on your chart:</strong> Once the numbers are in, the Golden Formula engine checks for flags, double tops/bottoms, rounding patterns, even-number reactions, and moving average behavior—exactly how I would.</li>
        <li><strong>4. You get a clear, human-style explanation:</strong> The output tells you the direction, entry, stop, target, and why the setup matters, in plain language.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is built to help you overcome the isolation of trading alone. Instead of staring at
        a chart wondering what to do, you can let the simulator walk you through the logic I use
        every day. It won’t make you skip the work—but it will make the work feel guided.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still strongly recommend learning the “why” behind every decision. That’s why this app
        is paired with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Glossary:</strong> A full glossary page so any word you don’t understand, you can look up instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Golden Rules:</strong> A page that lays out the core rules I trade by.</li>
        <li><strong>Golden Discipline:</strong> A page focused on discipline, emotional control, and the mental side of trading.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You’ve already taken a huge step just by being here and using this app. If you stay
        disciplined, keep learning, and use tools like this with respect for risk, trading can
        genuinely change your life.
