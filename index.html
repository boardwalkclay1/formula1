    <!-- HERO / WHAT THIS APP IS -->
    <section class="gf-hero">
      <h2>Simple, Obvious Setups Only</h2>
      <p>
        Golden Formula is my trading brain turned into a tool. It looks for clean moving average
        behavior, obvious highs and lows, reactions at even numbers, and simple reversal patterns.
        No complicated jargon—just “up or down”, “where to enter”, “where to cut it”, and “which
        options contract makes sense”.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use this app, you’re not getting random signals. You’re getting my personal logic,
        encoded into rules, so it feels like I’m sitting right next to you, walking you through the
        chart and the options chain.

      <h2>Trade Alive – My Trading Academy</h2>
      <p>
        Trade Alive is my academy and education hub. If you want to understand how the market
        actually works—beyond hype and guessing—that’s where I break everything down. I’ve spent
        over 10 years learning, testing, and refining these ideas so you don’t have to do it alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same logic that powers this app is what I used to turn a small account into
        <strong>$40,000 in 5 days</strong>. Not by gambling, but by following clear rules,
        respecting risk, and only taking the most obvious setups.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to go deeper, learn the full system, and see how all of this fits together,
        you can go straight to my academy and code here:

      </p>
      <p>
        This app is built to help you overcome one of the hardest parts of trading: doing it alone.
        With Golden Formula, you can upload a chart in the simulator and instantly see how I would
        read it, what I would look for, and how I would think about the trade. It won’t replace
        learning, but it will make the learning feel guided instead of lonely.

    <!-- HOW THE APP FLOWS -->
    <section class="gf-flow">
      <h2>How the Golden Formula App Works</h2>
      <p>
        The app is split into a few focused pieces that all work together:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Golden Simulator:</strong> You upload a chart screenshot or paste numbers, and the
          engine reads price, highs/lows, and moving averages. It then runs my rules to decide if
          there’s a clean setup, what direction I’d lean, and where I’d place entry, stop, and target.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Options Picker:</strong> Once a setup is found, the options page builds an options
          chain around your entry, highlights the contract I’d choose, and explains why—timeframe,
          moneyness, risk, and how it fits the setup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Golden Rules:</strong> A page that lays out the core rules I trade by, so you can
          see the logic behind the engine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Golden Discipline:</strong> A page focused on discipline, emotional control, and
          the mental side of trading—because the best logic in the world doesn’t matter if you can’t
          control your impulses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Glossary:</strong> A full glossary so any word you don’t understand, you can look
          up instantly while you’re using the app.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You’ve already taken a big step just by being here. If you stay disciplined, keep learning,
        and use tools like this with respect for risk, trading can genuinely change your life.
