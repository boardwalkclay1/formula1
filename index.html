      <h2>Welcome to Golden Formula</h2>
      <p>
        This isn’t just another trading tool. This is my personal logic — the same logic I’ve used
        for years — turned into a system you can use every day. Golden Formula focuses on clean,
        obvious setups: moving average behavior, reactions at even numbers, simple reversals, and
        clear highs and lows. No noise. No confusion. Just clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use this app, you’re not guessing. You’re seeing the market the way I see it.
        Every chart you upload, every setup you test, every options chain you build — it all runs
        through the same rules I trade with.
      </p>

    <section class="gf-trade_alive">
      <h2>Trade Alive – My Trading Academy</h2>
      <p>
        Trade Alive is where I teach the full system behind this app. If you want to understand
        how the market actually works — not the hype, not the gambling, but the real mechanics —
        that’s where you start. I’ve spent over 10 years learning, refining, and testing these
        ideas so you don’t have to do it alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same logic that powers Golden Formula is what I used to turn a small account into
        <strong>$40,000 in 5 days</strong>. Not luck. Not guessing. Just discipline, structure,
        and only taking the most obvious setups.
      </p>
      <p>

    <!-- HOW THE APP WORKS -->
    <section class="gf-flow">
      <h2>How the Golden Formula App Works</h2>
      <p>
        The app is built to guide you step‑by‑step through the same process I use every day:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Golden Simulator:</strong> Upload a chart screenshot and the app reads the price,
          highs/lows, and moving averages. It then runs my personal rule engine to determine the
          direction, entry, stop, target, and strength of the setup.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Golden Chart:</strong> The simulator draws a clean chart with your entry, stop,
          and target marked — so you can visualize the trade exactly how I would.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Options Picker:</strong> Once a setup is found, the options page builds a full
          options chain around your entry, highlights the contract I would choose, and explains
          why — timeframe, moneyness, risk, and how it fits the setup.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Golden Rules:</strong> A breakdown of the core rules I trade by. These are the
          same rules the engine uses.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Golden Discipline:</strong> A page dedicated to emotional control, discipline,
          and the mental side of trading — because the best logic in the world means nothing if
          you can’t control yourself.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Glossary:</strong> A full glossary so any word you don’t understand, you can
          look up instantly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You’ve already taken a huge step just by being here. If you stay disciplined, keep
        learning, and use tools like this with respect for risk, trading can genuinely change
        your life.
      </p>
