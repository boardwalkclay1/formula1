      <h2>Plain‑Language Trading Terms</h2>
      <p>
        This glossary is written for people who don’t know the market yet. No heavy jargon, just
        simple explanations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="gf-glossary">
      <h3>Price</h3>
      <p>The current value of the stock. What it’s trading at right now.</p>

      <h3>High / Low</h3>
      <p>The highest and lowest prices the stock has traded at during the chosen time period.</p>

      <h3>Moving Average (MA)</h3>
      <p>
        A smooth line that shows the average price over a set number of candles. It helps you see
        the general direction instead of every tiny wiggle.
      </p>

      <h3>Golden Cross</h3>
      <p>
        When the faster moving average crosses above the slower one. It often means the trend is
        turning up.
      </p>

      <h3>Death Cross</h3>
      <p>
        When the faster moving average crosses below the slower one. It often means the trend is
        turning down.
      </p>

      <h3>Even Number Level</h3>
      <p>
        A clean, simple price like 10, 15, 20, 100. Price often reacts around these levels because
        they are easy for humans to see and remember.
      </p>

      <h3>Double Bottom</h3>
      <p>
        Price drops, bounces, drops again to about the same area, and then bounces harder. It looks
        like a “W” and can signal a possible move up.
      </p>

      <h3>Double Top</h3>
      <p>
        Price rises, pulls back, rises again to about the same area, and then falls. It looks like
        an “M” and can signal a possible move down.
      </p>

      <h3>Rounding Bottom / Top</h3>
      <p>
        A slow, curved turn instead of a sharp V. A rounding bottom can lead to an up move; a
        rounding top can lead to a down move.
      </p>

      <h3>Call Option</h3>
      <p>
        A contract that benefits if the stock goes up. In this project we just say “CALL = bet on up”.
      </p>

      <h3>Put Option</h3>
      <p>
        A contract that benefits if the stock goes down. In this project we just say “PUT = bet on down”.
      </p>

      <h3>Stop Loss</h3>
      <p>
        A planned exit point where you accept a small loss so you don’t let it turn into a big one.
        Here we use a simple idea: about 20% risk from your entry.
