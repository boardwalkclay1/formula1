      <h3>How Trade Alive Fits In</h3>
      <p>
        Trade Alive is my trading academy and education hub. The Golden Formula tools are a
        hands‑on way to see how I think about entries, exits, and risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same rules that helped me make <strong>$40,000 in 5 days</strong> are baked into this
        system: obvious setups, strict stops, and no over‑complication.
