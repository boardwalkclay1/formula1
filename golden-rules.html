      <h2>The Core Rules I Trade By</h2>
      <p>
        These are the rules behind the Golden Formula. They are simple on purpose. The goal is to
        only take trades that are obvious, clean, and easy to explain to a beginner.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Only trade obvious setups.</strong>
          If you have to squint or argue with yourself, skip it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use two moving averages as your backbone.</strong>
          One fast, one slow. When they cross and price respects them, pay attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Respect highs, lows, and even numbers.</strong>
          Big turns often happen at clean levels: prior highs/lows and simple even prices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wait for a clear reversal candle.</strong>
          Don’t guess bottoms or tops. Let the candle show a real fight and flip.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Only trade full patterns.</strong>
          Double bottoms, double tops, rounding bottoms, rounding tops—no half‑built shapes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Always know your stop before you enter.</strong>
          A simple rule: about 20% risk from your entry idea.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Never chase.</strong>
          If price already left your even number or your zone, let it go.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>One clear idea at a time.</strong>
          Either you’re playing a bounce, a breakdown, or a breakout—not all three.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Size small enough to sleep.</strong>
          If you can’t sleep with the position on, it’s too big.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review every trade.</strong>
          Win or lose, ask: did I follow the rules or did I freestyle?
        </li>
      </ol>
